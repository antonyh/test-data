Test Data

This is a project to collect input files useful in assembling test data, and some basic tools to create useful sample input files (such as SQL statements, JSON data, vCards, and so on). 

Roadmap, next up:

- the name lists currently contain only ASCII text; the next step is to add a broader range of names.
- build some basic tools to construct sample data

Later...:

- add some address generation 
- perhaps some sort of templating
- add more sample data files, such as taxonomies
